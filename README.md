Hello!

This repo currently contains a bunch of half-baked projects I'm trying out with Brian Jepson. It's not fit for anyone else's consumption yet.  Some of it is based on phonegap-nfc, which you can find here:
	
https://github.com/don/phonegap-nfc

I suggest you go try that out first, before you bother making sense of my mess.

Best,
Tom
